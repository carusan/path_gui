# path_gui
A C++ Qt GUI project I made for a university course. The project aims to recreate the traditional Polku game. The uploaded files may not work correctly since I pulled them outside of Qt Creator. NOTE! I have only produced the GUI for this game: the logic behind the game was produced by course staff while I produced the GUI from the ground up.
